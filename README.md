# Nongkikuy - Restaurant Catalogue
Here's a fully functional Progressive Web App I built from scratch for public use. This is the final project of the submission to become a Front-End Web Developer Expert program with Coding X IDCamp Indosat Ooredo. This web application reveals the power of a UI for mobile devices that can be used offline.

## Features
Things you can do when using Nongkikuy are:
* View the list of available restaurants
* Find a restaurant via the search bar
* See the restaurant in detail
* Save your favorite restaurants locally to view them even when offline
* Read and make a review
